      <h1>Discover the Capitol Building</h1>
      <p>
        The United States Capitol, often called the Capitol or the Capitol
        Building, is the seat of the United States Congress, the legislative
        branch of the federal government. It is located on Capitol Hill at the
        eastern end of the National Mall in Washington, D.C. Although no longer
        at the geographic center of the national capital, the U.S. Capitol forms
        the origin point for the street-numbering system of the district as well
        as its four quadrants. Like the principal buildings of the executive and
        judicial branches, the Capitol is built in a neoclassical style and has
        a white exterior.
