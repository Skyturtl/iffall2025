            Planned as the focal point of L'Enfant's city, the Capitol broadcasts
            American neoclassicism—temple fronts, porticoes, and a commanding
            dome—to link the young republic to Rome. The sequence of architects
            set that language: William Thornton's 1793 scheme established the
            central massing; Benjamin Henry Latrobe rebuilt interiors and
            introduced robust classical detailing; Charles Bulfinch completed the
            early building with a low copper-clad dome. Mid-century growth brought
            Thomas U. Walter (with August Schoenborn) to design larger House and
            Senate wings and the present dome, completed under Edward Clark.
