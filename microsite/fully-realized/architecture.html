          <h1>Neoclassical language & authorship</h1>
          <p>
            Planned as the focal point of L'Enfant's city, the Capitol
            broadcasts American neoclassicism—temple fronts, porticoes, and a
            commanding dome—to link the young republic to Rome. The sequence of
            architects set that language: William Thornton's 1793 scheme
            established the central massing; Benjamin Henry Latrobe rebuilt
            interiors and introduced robust classical detailing; Charles
            Bulfinch completed the early building with a low copper-clad dome.
            Mid-century growth brought Thomas U. Walter (with August Schoenborn)
            to design larger House and Senate wings and the present dome,
            completed under Edward Clark.

          <h1>How the dome was made</h1>
          <p>
            Walter replaced Bulfinch's underscaled dome with a much taller
            cast-iron, double-shell structure that could sit on the existing
            masonry drum. Prefabricated iron ribs and rings—fabricated by Janes,
            Fowler, Kirtland & Co. with a surrounding colonnade by Poole &
            Hunt—were hoisted by derricks and bolted in place, creating separate
            inner and outer shells. The inner oculus reveals Constantino
            Brumidi's Apotheosis of Washington; above, a tholos supports Thomas
            Crawford's Statue of Freedom (set in 1863). Iron kept weight low
            enough to avoid rebuilding foundations.

          <h1>Architectural challenges</h1>
          <p>
            The building endured the 1814 burning, soft Aquia sandstone that
            weathered poorly, and the 1850s problem of restoring proportion
            after wing expansions—solved by the lighter, larger iron dome.
            Later, corrosion, cracking, and water intrusion in the iron shell
            prompted major conservation, most recently the scaffolding campaign
            and envelope repairs completed in 2016.

            The East Front was extended in 1958–62 in marble, and the original
            sandstone columns were moved offsite (now the National Capitol
            Columns at the U.S. National Arboretum). Landscape architect
            Frederick Law Olmsted (1874–1892) anchored the enlarged mass with
            broad marble terraces and formal grounds, effectively creating a
            podium that stabilizes views from the Mall and city streets.
