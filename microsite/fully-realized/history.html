            Prior to establishing the nation's capital in Washington, D.C., the
            United States Congress and its predecessors met at Independence Hall
            and Congress Hall in Philadelphia, Federal Hall in New York City,
            and five additional locations. The First Continental Congress
            brought together delegates from the colonies in Philadelphia,
            followed by the Second Continental Congress, which met from May 1775
            to March 1781.

            After adopting the Articles of Confederation in York, Pennsylvania,
            the Congress of the Confederation was formed and convened in
            Philadelphia from March 1781 until June 1783, when a mob of angry
            soldiers converged upon Independence Hall, demanding payment for
            their service during the American Revolutionary War. Congress
            requested that John Dickinson, the Governor of Pennsylvania, call up
            the militia to defend Congress from attacks by the protesters. In
            what became known as the Pennsylvania Mutiny of 1783, Dickinson
            sympathized with the protesters and refused to remove them from
            Philadelphia. As a result, Congress was forced to flee to Princeton,
            New Jersey, on June 21, 1783, and met in Annapolis, Maryland, and
            Trenton, New Jersey, before ending up in New York City.

            The Senate (north) wing was completed in 1800. The Senate and House
            shared quarters in the north wing until a temporary wooden pavilion
            was erected on the future site of the House wing which served for a
            few years for the Representatives to meet in, until the House of
            Representatives (south) wing was finally completed in 1811, with a
            covered wooden temporary walkway connecting the two wings with the
            Congressional chambers where the future center section with rotunda
            and dome would eventually be. However, the House of Representatives
            moved early into their House wing in 1807. Though the Senate wing
            building was incomplete, the Capitol held its first session of the
            U.S. Congress with both chambers in session on November 17, 1800.
            The National Legislature was moved to Washington prematurely, at the
            urging of President John Adams, in hopes of securing enough Southern
            votes in the Electoral College to be re-elected for a second term as
            president.

            In March 1803, James Madison appointed Benjamin Henry Latrobe to the
            position of "Surveyor of Public Buildings", with the principal
            responsibility of completing construction of the Capitol's south and
            north wings. Work on the north wing began in November 1806. Although
            occupied for only six years, it had suffered from falling plaster,
            rotting floors and a leaking roof. Instead of repairing it, Latrobe
            demolished, redesigned and rebuilt the interiors within the existing
            brick and sandstone walls. Notably, Latrobe designed the Supreme
            Court and Senate chambers. The former was a particular architectural
            achievement; the size and structure of its vaulted, semi-circular
            ceiling was then unprecedented in the United States.

            In 1958, the next major expansion to the Capitol started, with a
            33.5-foot (10.2 m) extension of the East Portico. In 1960, two years
            into the project, the dome underwent a restoration. A marble
            duplicate of the sandstone East Front was built 33.5 feet (10.2 m)
            from the old Front. In 1962, a connecting extension repurposed what
            had been an outside wall as an inside wall. In the process, the
            original sandstone Corinthian columns were removed and replaced with
            marble. It was not until 1984 that landscape designer Russell Page
            created a suitable setting for them in a large meadow at the U.S.
            National Arboretum in northeast Washington as the National Capitol
            Columns, where they were combined with a reflecting pool into an
            ensemble that reminds some visitors of the ruins of Persepolis, in
            Persia.

            Besides the columns, two hundred tons of the original stone were
            removed in several hundred blocks, which were first stored on site
            at the Capitol, and then stored in an unused yard at the Capitol
            Power Plant until 1975. The same year, the power plant was renovated
            and expanded in accordance with legislation passed in 1970, and the
            stones fell to the Commission on the Extension of the United States
            Capitol. As this body was long defunct, responsibility for the
            material passed to the House and Senate office building commissions.
            These commissions then arranged for the National Park Service to
            store the debris at the back of a NPS maintenance yard in Rock Creek
            Park

            On June 20, 2000, ground was broken for the Capitol Visitor Center,
            which opened on December 2, 2008. From 2001 through 2008, the East
            Front of the Capitol (site of most presidential inaugurations until
            Ronald Reagan began a new tradition in 1981) was the site of
            construction for this massive underground complex, designed to
            facilitate a more orderly entrance for visitors to the Capitol.
            Prior to the center being built, visitors to the Capitol had to line
            up in the basement of the Cannon House Office Building or the
            Russell Senate Office Building. The new underground facility
            provides a grand entrance hall, a visitors theater, room for
            exhibits, and dining and restroom facilities, in addition to space
            for building necessities such as a service tunnel.

            A large-scale Capitol dome restoration project, the first extensive
            such work since 1959-1960, began in 2014, with completion scheduled
            before the 2017 presidential inauguration. As of 2012, $20 million
            in work around the skirt of the dome had been completed, but other
            deterioration, including at least 1,300 cracks in the brittle iron
            that have led to rusting and seepage inside, needed to be addressed.
            Before the August 2012 recess, the Senate Appropriations Committee
            voted to spend $61 million to repair the exterior of the dome. The
            House wanted to spend less on government operations, but in late
            2013, it was announced that renovations would take place over two
            years, starting in spring 2014.
