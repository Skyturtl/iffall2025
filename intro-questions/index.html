    <h1>Intro Questions</h1>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Provide your name, major, year in school (sophomore, junior, etc).</strong></li>
        <p>William Chen, Computer Science, Senior.</p>
      <li><strong>Tell us a bit about your background and what prompted you to take this class.</strong></li>
        <p>I have a background in some fullstack development on my own for fun but nothing professional. I took web dev (CSE 2004) and everything else is self taught. I took this class for my HCI minor.</p>
      <li><strong>Do you have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS? If so, tell us a bit about it.</strong></li>
        <p>I have some experience with HTML, CSS, and JS through personal projects and web dev.</p>
      <li><strong>Name one thing you hope to learn in this class.</strong></li>
        <p> I hope to learn more creative designs rather than simply just making to make.</p>
      <li><strong>Name one way you expect designing for screen to be different from designing for paper.</strong></li>
        <p> I expect it to be more dynamic and for the feel to feel good rather than paper where you are mostly just looking at the page. But for the website it should be easy find what you need and comfortable to use. </p>
      <li><strong>Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective design. Explain your choice.</strong></li>
        <p> https://www.apple.com is a website that has clean layouts, high quality animations and images, as well as intuitive navigation in order to show off their products. Their website while has a lot of transitions and many moving components still maintains focus on selling their product.  </p>
      <li><strong>Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective communication. Explain your choice.</strong></li>
        <p> https://www.wikipedia.org is a website that exemplifies effective communication as it has minimal design but allows users to find everything that they need to. It isn't complicated and doesn't have fancy colors which might distract from the content.</p>
      <li><strong>Provide a link to a website you think works well. Explain your choice.</strong></li>
        <p> https://www.reddit.com is a website that works well as it has a simple layout and allows users to easily find and engage with content that interests them. The upvote/downvote system helps to surface the most relevant posts, and the use of subreddits allows for easy navigation of different topics.</p>
